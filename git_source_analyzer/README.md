A rudimentary sample demonstrating the git partial clone + sparse checkout method.

## What does it do

1. Given a git url and a path to package
2. perform a partial clone of the repo to the disk (without all trees and blobs)
3. perform a sparse checkout on the required pubspec.yaml
4. loop through all tags to scrape all applicable pubspec.yaml
5. all found version of the discovered package.

## Usage

```bash
dart main.dart <url to git repo> <path to package>
```

```bash
# Simple example, still took 274 seconds on 53 tags
dart main.dart https://github.com/rrousselGit/provider /

# Heavy load test, would take quite a lot of time to complete
dart main.dart https://github.com/flutter/plugins packages/camera/camera
```

## Evaluation
Currently the performance is not quite acceptable, in a Google Cloud Shell environment, 
it took about 5 seconds for initialization and extra 5 seconds for each tag it has to fetch. There 
are different techniques to optimize this, for example to fetch multiple instances of such repo concurrently 
and to limit the number of tags required to process by doing pattern matching on tags to be scanned.
